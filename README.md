With double dollar symbols around the latex it work OK.

```
$$y = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x^2-x$$
```

$$y = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x^2-x$$

With single dollar symbols around the latex it appears to be messed up.

```
$y = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x^2-x$
```

$y = \sum_{x=0}^\infty x^2-x$

Well time has moved on an it looks ok now.
